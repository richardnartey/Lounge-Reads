					Throughout our entire life, we face life’s inevitable situations. Situations we never desired for, but, nor, neither we have control and power to change them. Sometimes, we wish a particular day in our lives does not exist or we wish some days in our lives should not have happened because of unforgettable pains such days leave within our souls and precisely, our minds. Some pains are not easy to be forgotten. They recall themselves anytime familiar incidents happen. When these strange and sophisticated situations bounce into our lives, we echo to the very first day we were born, and, wished we were not. But, truly, all these things happen for our own good if we can manage and grow massively with it. We can convalesce from all pains of life by building a strong and incredible foundations of resilience. And with that, we can withstand all life storms and learn from it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Resilience-- the ability to bounce back to address a failure or a mess in life. No matter how regrettable life situations may be, building resilience will shield you with the ability to prepare and recover from all life unpredictable situations. Whenever hard storms of life hits us, we rarely seek to continue in life. At this very spot of life, we look down on ourselves and failure and devious emotions conquer our minds like snake’s venom does to its prey. But if we can manage to leave all those awful days of life behind; build resilience; we will be fully equipped to root our minds against the overwhelming and backstabbing issues of life. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Since humanity cannot correctly predict the future, so as we cannot be sure of what is next to what is happening now, we ought to learn how to embrace failure. With such secrets of life, embrace failure. When failure pops up in a journey towards something great, do not run from it because when you do, it shall remain hunting you emotionally. And remember emotionally pains are too far severe as compared to physical pains. For instance, compare a day your teacher canned you or a day you were hurt by a knife (physical pains) to a day you lost a love one, failed an exam, you were cheated on, embarrassed, or lost a job (emotional pains). You will finally be acquainted that the physical pains are gone (i.e. you do not feel the pains from your teacher’s cane nor the wounds of the knife anymore), but those emotional pains (lost a love one, failed an exam, cheated on, embarrassed, lost a job) still do have spaces in your mind. They still hurt when you remember them, aren’t they? I once had a re-sit on one of my university courses. Upon that failure, I intended to drop school and continue with something else. But through the incomparable power of resilience I was able to sit again and had the course with a great outcome. If had ran from this life failure, it would have been hurting me now. But because I embraced it and dealt with it, I do not remember that failure anymore and if I do it, the success I had from embracing the failure erases it by surpassing over it with an incredible joy.

					When Thomas Edison, an American, and the inventor of light bulb was interviewed, the host said <q><i>It’s been alleged that you failed nine hundred and ninety-nine (999) consecutive times before getting this invention done (light bulb). Is that true?</i></q> Thomas Edison from the experience he had about resilience replied <q><i>No. I didn’t fail nine hundred and ninety-nine (999) consecutive times, but I learned how to invent a light bulb in nine hundred and ninety-nine different ways.</i></q> Thomas Edison embraced failure through resilience and now he is world’s most intelligent and creativity personnel we all learn from. We can do the same if we eventually build a strong wall of resilience.
				</p>

				<p>
					Remember, failures are part of life and through reliance we can turn them into a meaning day in our lives. Resilience really counts in life journeys. Develop it and you shall always be happy in the mind.
