				<h3 class="article-header">Hard work</h3>
				<i class="author">Author: Richard Nartey</i>
				<p>
					Have you ever wondered how someone could do something really amazing and incredible, and you will be like ‘Wow! How did you do that?’ or ‘Wow! How could you do that? It’s really wonderful and fascinating.’ All those incredible things you see with your eyes, you hear with your ears, and, even, the ones you dream of bringing them into reality, can only be attained through the incomparable power of hard work. Hard work at its peak is so strong and powerful than anything you may think of. All the awesome things in this our world were brought into existence through the great power of hard work. It is barely possible that one can identify his or her true talent without being a hard-worker. In my thorough studies and real-life situations, I have witnessed clear portrays that hard work is more essential in human life than talent.
				</p>

				<p>
					Hard work is the foundational flame on which all talents are built. Hard work when properly demonstrated happens to be the root that nourishes our talents and makes it grow like a tree planted by the riverside. Stephen King, an American author once said “Talent is cheaper than table salt. What separates the talented individual from the successful one is hard work.” From this quote, it is transparent that no matter how talented you may be, it takes only hard work to be successful with your talents. So, being there idle and waiting for your talents to pay off, it’s actually not the right thing to do. Hymn 252 of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which happens to be one of my favorite hymns says ‘Put Your Shoulder to the Wheel’ and work hard to better serve others with your God-given talents.	 
				</p>

				<p>
					Moreover, from my personal investigations and some investigations from some expertise, hard work is the link through which a talent can be discovered. When I was in my second year in the high school, I experienced a great fall in my academic records: I mean my grades. My teachers arranged several meetings with me wanting to know the exact reasons leading to this great fall in my academics. After several meetings have been held, my teachers came to realize that I have come to trust my talent of intelligence and therefore, I am not working hard on it because I believe since I have the talent nothing more really matters. Later, my teachers advised me to erase such an awful idea from my mind and be willing to work hard on my academics. And, as I did whatever they told me—learning hard, researching and questioning, I retained my standard of academics and even better than previous. Finally, I came to understand that no matter how sharp or good your talent is, it needs hard work to make it powerful and useable.
				</p>

				<p>
					Most people think that talent is something that comes on its own, but, actually, that is really not true, because talent with no hard work is like a plant in a garden with no water and other nutrients to grow. Truly, have we ever seen an idle man counting his success or naming his properties before? The only answer to this question is a big ‘NO.’ I know you’re wondering ‘Where in the world could this happen?’ I know there are a lot sayings in the air that talent does it all. But just carefully analyze the ‘Idle man’, could it be possible he can count his success and properties? As he cannot, so as talents being not toiled on has no usefulness in this world.	
				</p>

				<p>
					In conclusion, to be a good user of your God-given talents, remember it only requires a keen and abundant hard work to make them a good service to others. Grab hold to your talents by thoroughly working hard on them and remember nothing really pays off than a true hard work.
